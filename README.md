# ðŸ¤™ Hey there!

I'm an independent consultant, staff-level software engineer, startup advisor and occasional investor. I use my expertise to help startups run their teams more effectively, build products faster, and minimize errors.

Currently learning and taking on new roles. Let's connect and talk about how I can help your startup grow!

I'm also the creator of [AirDesktop](https://airdesktop.notion.site), an XR virtual workspace app for glasses like Xreal Air.
